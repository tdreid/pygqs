# pygqs

A quick start template for `pygame` projects

1. Imports `logging` and sets level to `INFO` 
2. Imports `randint()` from `random` because so many games need dice or similar
3. Defines RGB values as constants for 16 basic colors
4. Imports and initalizes `pygame`
5. Configures surface to serve as main game window â€” adjust `HEIGHT` and `WIDTH` as desired
6. Sets up main game loop
